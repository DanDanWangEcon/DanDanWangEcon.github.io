### Emulated Neurons
Neural networks are built on units called neurons, and for this exercise a special neuron called a perceptron is used.
Perceptrons are special in that they can represent fundamental logic functions: AND, OR, NAND, NOR. Though
a perceptron canâ€™t represent XAND or XOR, layered perceptrons can, thus all logic functions can potentially be
built using a layered network structure.

Perceptrons work by multiplying a vector of inputs by a weight vector and passing the sum of that input-weight vectors through an activation function. For this exercise I used the sigmoid function, but there are many others. Weights are [nxm] matrices, where n is the dimension of the input and m is the dimension of the output.

Here is a sketch algorithm to implement a perceptron node:

$$
\sigma = \frac{1}{1+e^{\Sigma (x_iw_i )}}
$$

$$
\epsilon=y-\sigma
$$
