Inside the retina are cone cells, photosensitive cells that differentiate color. Humans have 3 different types of cones;(S)mall,(M)edium, and (L)arge, corresponding to the length of the wavelength that excites it. The sum of the excitement amplitudes of each type of cone is perceived to us as color.
