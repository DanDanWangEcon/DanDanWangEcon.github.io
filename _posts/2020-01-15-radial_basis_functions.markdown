Inside the retina are cone cells, photosensitive cells that differentiate color. Humans have 3 different types of cones; <strong>S</strong>mall, <strong>M</strong>edium, and <strong>L</strong>arge, corresponding to the length of the wavelength that excites it. The sum of the excitement amplitudes of each type of cone is perceived to us as color.
