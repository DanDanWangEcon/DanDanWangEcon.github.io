#### Pearce Services - Design Engineer...
#### <su>2016 - 2019</su>

My main responsibility was designing infrastructure plans for fiber and cable construction projects. Foresight was critical as anything not accounted for would delay the project. I coordinated with the lead engineer, field engineer, and other contractors to move the project forward in a timely but comprehensive manner.

#### Drive Spotter - Product Engineer...
#### <su>2015 - 2016</su>

At Drive Spotter I developed a working prototype using computer vision and machine learning tools.
Because the company was in its infancy I acted as many roles, addressing CEOs, investors, and
vendors. A smaller aspect of my role was conducting prior art research and assisting in writing, editing, and revising patents and proposals.

#### Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago - Research Intern...
#### <su>2014</su>

I interned at RIC within the Sensory Motor Performance Program. Our project was to create an adaptive wheelchair controller for spinal-cord injury patients using IMUs. Using machine learning techniques we created a controller that was able to calibrate and integrate IMU datastreams, primarily using Matlab. Our experimental results were then presented in an open forum setting.
