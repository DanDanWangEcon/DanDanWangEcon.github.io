### Experience
#### Pearce Services - Design Engineer...
<small>2014 - 2019</small>

My main responsibility was designing infrastructure plans for fiber and cable construction projects. Foresight was critical as anything not accounted for would delay the project. I coordinated with the lead engineer, field engineer, and other contractors to move the project forward in a timely but comprehensive manner.
