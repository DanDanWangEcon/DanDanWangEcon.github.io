My name is Alex Hay. I'm currently a masters student of robotics at Northwestern University in Chicago. My passion lies in prosthetics and learning new ways of augmenting human ability.

I earned my BS in mechanical engineering in 2014 at Iowa State University. Upon graduating I completed my internship at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (rebuilt at the [Shirley Ryan Ability Lab](https://www.sralab.org/)) before moving on to the start-up world. Both experiences helped cultivate an appreciation for biomimicry and building artificially analogous systems.
