**Dandan Wang** serves as an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [LiaoNing University](https://enweb.lnu.edu.cn/),  focusing on the development and maintenance of machine learning and econometric toolboxes, with particular emphasising on methods for analysing complex systems involving agent-based models and policy simulations related to climate change and inequality.

Her academic pursuits are centred around applying machine learning techniques to public policy challenges, with a particular emphasis on addressing inequality and environmental issues. She leverages econometric methods, machine learning, and agent-based models to analyse the complex interactions between economic policies, climate change, and societal well-being.

Her research interests include but are not limited to:
* Machine Learning
* Econometrics
* Agent Based Models
* Inequality
* Environment and Climate Change
* Mental Health


<!-- I'm currently a masters student of robotics at Northwestern University in Chicago. My passion lies in prosthetics, learning new ways of augmenting human ability, and making new methodologies accessible.

I received my BS in mechanical engineering in 2014 at Iowa State University. I completed my internship at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (rebuilt as the [Shirley Ryan Ability Lab](https://www.sralab.org/)) then moved on to the start-up world developing computer vision technologies. In 2019, I was accepted into the Masters of Science in Robotics program at Northwestern University.

Disability or impairment in the wake of trauma may be difficult or impossible for the body to overcome. My professional goal is to help build systems that interact with the body to improve function, strength, and ability. By understanding how the body's underlying systems operates and communicate, we can build devices that interact with the body in a much more natural way.-->

<!-- By watching how mother nature overcomes her challenges, we can incorporate those lessons into engineering design. When we apply those naturally inspired systems, not only do we learn more about our own world, but we develop a deeper respect for it. -->

 <!-- How does the body provide blood to every cell, and could we use that system and apply it to our roads and highways? Can we use novel piezoelectric materials as artificial muscles? What can CNNs teach us about our own visul cortex?  -->
