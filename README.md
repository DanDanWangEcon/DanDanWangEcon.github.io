# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Dandan Wang**, an Assistant Professor of Economics at **Liaoning University**. I specialize in the development and maintenance of machine learning and econometric toolboxes, with a particular emphasis on methods for analyzing complex systems. My work often involves **agent-based models** and **policy simulations** to address critical public policy challenges related to **climate change** and **inequality**.

## About Me
My academic pursuits are driven by a passion for applying advanced **machine learning techniques** to public policy, aiming to tackle some of the most pressing issues of our time. By leveraging **econometric methods**, **machine learning**, and **agent-based models**, I study the intricate interactions between **economic policies**, **climate change**, and **societal well-being**.

## Research Interests
- **Machine Learning**: Techniques and applications in economics and public policy.
- **Econometrics**: Advanced methods for analyzing complex economic relationships.
- **Agent-Based Models**: Simulation of complex systems with interacting agents.
- **Inequality**: Understanding and addressing disparities in economic outcomes.
- **Environment and Climate Change**: Policy impact analysis related to environmental sustainability.
- **Mental Health**: Examining the economic implications and policy aspects of mental health.


## Let's Connect
